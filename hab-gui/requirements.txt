# Python packages installable via pip
PySide6>=6.5

pyqtgraph>=0.13.0

# IMPORTANT: GNU Radio and SoapySDR are NOT pip-installable
# They must be system-installed first via Homebrew on macOS
#
# Installation Steps:
# 1. Install system dependencies via Homebrew:
#    brew install gnuradio soapysdr soapyhackrf hackrf
#
# 2. Create virtual environment with --system-site-packages flag:
#    python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
#    source .venv/bin/activate
#
#    This flag is REQUIRED to access the system-installed GNU Radio and SoapySDR
#    libraries from within the virtual environment.
#
# 3. Install Python-only packages:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Why --system-site-packages?
# - GNU Radio is installed system-wide by Homebrew (not in venv)
# - This flag allows the venv to import system-installed packages
# - Without this flag, Python won't be able to find GNU Radio modules
