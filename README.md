# HAB â€” High Altitude Balloon Project

## Overview

This project builds a highâ€‘altitude balloon payload and matching ground station capable of:
- Capturing and transmitting onboard sensor data and imagery from the stratosphere
- Streaming a highâ€‘bandwidth video downlink using DVBâ€‘S2
- Sending a robust QPSK packet telemetry link for flight state (GPS, altitude, environment)

## System Architecture

### Balloon Payload
- Embedded Linux board (e.g., Orange Pi Zero 3)
- HackRF SDR as RF front end for transmission
- Cameras for video capture
- Weather and atmospheric sensors (see Sensor Suite)

### RF Links (two downlinks)
1. Video downlink: DVBâ€‘S2
2. Telemetry downlink: QPSK packet telemetry (GPS, barometric altitude, temperature, etc.)

### Ground Station
- HackRF SDR receiver
- Custom GUI in `hab-gui/` to:
  - Demodulate DVBâ€‘S2 video
  - Demodulate QPSK telemetry packets
  - Provide realâ€‘time spectrum analysis and monitoring
  - Display and log telemetry

Refer to `hab-gui/README.md` for detailed groundâ€‘station setup (GNU Radio, SoapySDR, HackRF) and run instructions.

## Current Status
- âœ… Ground station GUI scaffolding complete; HackRF integration in place
- ðŸš§ Bringing up GUI ground station to receive DVBâ€‘S2 video and QPSK telemetry
- ðŸ“‹ Next: Full telemetry pipeline and endâ€‘toâ€‘end flight test

## Sensor Suite (examples)

### Core sensors (essential)
- BME280/BME680 â€” Temperature, pressure, humidity (I2C)
- GPS module (uâ€‘blox NEOâ€‘M8N/M9N class) â€” Lat/Lon/Altitude, velocity (UART)

### Extended sensors (recommended)
- VEML6075 â€” UVA/UVB index (I2C)
- MQ131 (or electrochemical O3 sensor) â€” Ozone concentration (analog)
- PMS5003 â€” Particulate matter PM2.5/PM10 (UART)
- Geiger counter module â€” Cosmic radiation (pulse count)
- MAG3110 (or HMC5883L) â€” Magnetometer (I2C)
- MPU6050 (or ICMâ€‘20948) â€” IMU 6â€‘9 DOF (I2C/SPI)

## Getting Started (Ground Station)
1. See `hab-gui/README.md` for system dependencies (Homebrew installs), venv setup, and running the app
2. Connect HackRF, configure frequency/sample rate/gains in the Connection tab
3. Start reception in the Telemetry tab; verify spectrum and packet flow
